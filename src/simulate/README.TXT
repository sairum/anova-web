Simulate data sets for analysis of variance. The code resides in 'simulate.js'. It takes advantage of:

normalize.css

jstat.js for RNG and statistics
chart.js (so fat a costum made chart plotting, may be replaced later by Chart.js)
FileSaver.js (to download files)
seedrandom.js as a RNG with seed capabilities
